.Sh NAME
.Nm splitexec
.Nd split standard input into pieces and execute a command for each piece
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl a Ar suffix_length
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Op Fl s Ar byte_count
.Ar utility Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes standard input, it writes it to temporary files then
executes
.Ar utility
once per temporary file.
Optional arguments may be passed to the
.Ar utility .
If the string
.Dq {}
appears anywhere in the utility name or the arguments it is replaced
by the pathname of the current file.

The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar suffix_length
Use
.Ar suffix_length
letters to form the suffix of the file name. The default suffix length is 3.
.It Fl k
Keep pieces after processing them.
The default is to remove each piece after
.Ar utility
exits.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
If
.Ar prefix
is specified, it is used as a prefix for the names of the files
into which the file is split. In this case, each file into which the file
is split is named by the prefix followed by a numericaly ordered suffix
using
.Ar suffix_length
characters in the range
.Dq 0-9 .
All temporary files are stored in the current directory.
.It Fl s Ar byte_count
Create files
.Ar byte_count
bytes in length.
No provision is made for any kind of unit
suffix, no
.Sq k ,
.Sq m ,
.Sq g
is supported.
The default value is 1073741824 (1GB).
.El

The
.Ar utility
argument must be present.

Undefined behaviour may occur if utility reads from the standard input.

The
.Nm
utility exits immediately (without processing any further input) if a command
line
cannot be assembled,
.Ar utility
cannot be invoked,
an invocation of utility is terminated by a signal, or
an invocation of
.Ar utility
exits with a value >0;
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm
utility is specially designed to integrate easily with backup routines,
for example when transferring large files to a remote host.

Move a full disk from local host to a remote host using scp:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
$ cd /tmp
$ splitexec -p myserverback scp {} user@rhost:mybackupdir/{}"
.Ed
.Pp
Will generate files myserverback.001, myserverback.002, ... in
.Ar rhost .
Using at no time more than
.Ar bytes_count
bytes for temporary files.

To recreate the original file from the pieces:

.Dl "$ cat myserverback.* > myserverback"
